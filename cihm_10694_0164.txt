’talos et tesseras. The tali (properly “knuckle-bones’')
were oblong and rounded at both ends. The other
four sides were numbered 1 (unio) and opposite to this
6 (senisu.- the other two were marked 3 (ternio) and
4 (quaternio), but the ends were not marked. The
tes-verae were regular cubes like our dice, and their
sides numbered from 1 to 6. The mla· and tesam-<ie
were shaken in a small box (fritillas), and then thrown
onatable (sorus). The highest throw‚ ( lf'ewm, Jactus
venereus, or basilicus) was 3 sixes of the temerae, and
of the tali, when all came out in different numbers.
The lowest throw (canis) was of the ces-serae, three
aces and of the tali, when all the numbers were the
same.

satrap of Lydia in &Vestem Asia. (Xen. Anab. Ι. 1).
Cicero here translates βασιλεὺς, a term often applied
to the satraps, while the monarch himself was called
μέγας βασιλεύς or simply βασιλεῦς. The story here
related is told in Xen. Oecon. IV. ἓ 20. Cicero

translated this work in his youth and perhaps copied

the anecdote here given from the translation.
