CHAPTER 1.-g 1.

ς 1.-¹0 Tite. Cicero, in dedicating this dialogue to his friend
Titus Pomponius Atticus, quotes some hexameter
verses, which in the Annales of Ennius are addressed
to Titus Quinctius Flamininus, the conqueror of

Macedonia. For forty days Flamininus had been
vainly endeavouring to find a path across the Pindus
range to attack Philip, the King of Macedon, when he
met a shepherd who offered to be his guide. The
victory of Cynoscephalae followed, 107 B. C. These
verses are spoken by the shepherd to Flamininus.

²quid: accusative, defining the eaetent or rumpas-s of the

ffition of the verb. H. 371, 1, 3) (2); Α. &G. 240, a;
. 229, 2.

³adj17ero=adjavera In the perfect and derived tenses
the letter vbetween two vowels is often suppressed
and (unless when a or e followsi or u) the second
vowel is merged into the first, as amaviesezmnasse,
but ‹neminemne-:audieram The shortening of ec
arises from the tendency to shorten a vowel before
another vowel.

⁴levasso=levavera Peile (Greek and Latin Etym. p. 296)
explains this form as originally levari-⁸0, then levavero
or lavaro. The second s in lev-asso is superfluous and
compensares for the loss of v and ἱ. For the sinking
of 8 to r: cp. asa, ‹litae-so, arbos, for the later forms
ara, quaero, arbor.

⁵coquic: “frets‚’' a metaphorical meaning not common
except in poetry. Cp. Virg. AEn. 7, 344; sil. 14, 103.

‘versam “keeps agitating, a frequentative from verto.
Notice the quantity of the final syllable. The quantity
of the 3rd sing. was not different originally from the
quantity of the :and sing. We have amittebtit (Virg.
AEn. 5, 853); ανᾶι (Hor. Od. 3, 12, 26) ; ridet (Hor.
Od. 2, 4, 14); vidit (Virg. AEn. 1, 308).
