§ 20.-¹amplissimum : “ the highest.''

²uc—-senes ι “ are also called (by the title) elders, as they
really are.'' The Spartan Senate (γερουσία) was an
aristocratic assembly composed of twenty-eight mem-
bers with the two kings as presidents. No one was
eligible sor this assembly unless he was 60 years osage,
of unblernished character and of good social standing.
In Cicero's time the first civil office that gave admission
to the senate was the quaestorship‚ which by the lex
annalis could be earliest held at the age of 31, but in
former times the age required may have been much
greater.

³si—voletis: distinguish this protasis from si velitis. H.
508 and 511 ; A. & G. 307, a.—eaeterna: “the his-
tory os foreign states.''

⁵ce1l0—cito : Scan z υυ-Ι--Ι--Ι υ-Ι--Ι--Ι
-- Ι υ- Ι , as Iambic 'l‘etrameter Acat, or Octo-
narius. H. 6863 A. 8: G. 366, b.--cedo qai: “tell
me, how‚'’ differing from praebe or dic, by the
notion of haste. cecl0; from‚--ce ademonstrative affix,
(meaning “here,'' rarely prefixed as in cea z ce-ve,
though often suffixed as in hic-ce) ; and do, connected
with dare, which is used in the sense of “tell ;’'
cp. Virg. Ecl. 1, 19; sed tamen iste deus qui sit, da,
Tityre, nobis. Hence ceclozce-dato, as cette=ce-date‚
cedre, then cl assimilated to t, cette.

“proueniebant—novi : “there came forth a crop of
unfledged orators.”—proveniebant is an agricultural
word, as in Caes. B. G. 5, 24 : frumentum propter
siccitates ιιηῃιιεείιιε provenerat, although it may also
be a stage word here as in, scenam provenire, “to come
on the stage ;‘’ Plautus, Ps. 1, 5, 155. The metre is
the same as above, thus· ool ——1——1—*1 υ-Ι
-υυι--ιυ-ι

'‘temeritas-aetatis: “rashness, you see, belongs to lise
in its bloom.'’—videlicet and scilicet both introduce an
explanation with this difference‚ that the former gener-
ally indicates the true, the latter, the wrong explanation,
though sometimes the meanings are reversed. Z. 345.
