“novi—aequitatem: “for l know the sels-control and
even balance of your mind.” Note the force of the
perfect, novi: cp. the Greek olda. So also odi, memini,
auevi, comneni, coepi are used as presentS.

¹⁵coynomen. T he sul! name of Cicero's friend was Titus
Pomponius Atticus. Distinguish praenomen, nomen,
coynomen, and aynomen.

¹⁰‹Ioportasae t a kind of technical military term, “ to bring
ιο Rome from the colonies :” as exercitum ‹lepor-tare.
In the post-Augustam writers it acquired another
meaning “ to banish to the colonies from Rome.” So
also the Latins say in going from a province, decede-re
de provincia. For the ease of Athenas, see ll. 421, J. 3
A. δι G. 254.

“humanitatem ec prudenciam .· “ your culture and practi-
cal wisdom.” The Latins used humanitas in a wide
sense to mean the polished ma mers and language, as
well as the liberal educationi, of a gentleman. ssy
prudentia (ε providentia) is meant, wisdom of apracti-
cal turn, defined by Cicero (N. D. 111. 15, 18);
sciencia rerum bonarum et malarum. The Stoics

looked upon this as a sovereign virtue. The charac-

ter of Atticus is given hy Nepos (Atticus. 17, 3):
nam et principum plziloxophorum ita percepta habuit
praecepta, uc eis ad vitam emendam, ‘non ad ostenta·
tionem uteretur.

¹⁸et tamen-commoveri .· “and notwithstanding (your cul·
ture and practical wisdom)‚ ί suspect that you are
occasionally too deeply troubled by the same state of
affairs as 1 myselfam.” Note the attraction of me ipsum
to the case of te, where the full construction would be,
quibus eqo ipse commoveor. See note 12, ἓ 1. For
the reference, see Introduction.

¹⁹quor20nz—vnajor: “ for which the consolation is a more
serious matter.” Others take mnjor as -τ difficilior.
Note the objective genitive. H. 396, 11. ; A. &G 217.

manne-conscribere: “now, however, 1 have made up
my mind to compose some work on old age (and dedi·
cate it) to you.'' ln the =²mple tenses, videtur is rarely
used impersonally, but in the compound tenses the
impersonal form is the regular construction. M. 400,
a. b. Cp. Cic. de Am., 4: Catone maiore, qui eat
scriptus ad ce de senectae.
