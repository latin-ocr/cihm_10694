‘es—oratio: cp. Hom. Il. ¹, 249: rof» καὶ ἀπὸ ὶἏώΜης
μέλιτος γλυκίων ῥέεν aiulo ς “ words. „weet as honey from
his lips ‹listille‹l.” (Pope.)

ἐααυὶειιιιίη : we should have expected dulcedinem from the
dulcior going before. Sum-icas is properly the sweet-
ness of odor, and frequently used sor enlm pleasnre :
dulcedo, pleasant ssavor, hence lively pleasure.

⁸duae: ille ε Agamemnon. Cp. Hom. 11. 2, 371, where
the same wish is expressed.

”Ajacem after similia with early writers the genitive is
more usual. Cicero uses the genitive of living objeets,
the genitive or dative ofthings. 11. 391, 2, 4), (2) ;
A. δ’( G. 234, d. R. Nestor is here introduced as an
excuse sor garrulity and an honourable example os old
age as Ajax is of brute strength and of youthful vigor.

”quod-acciderit ε “ and ifthis were to happen to him.”

§sa-mm: see note on 4, ἓ 28.-ayo: “I am now in :''
literally‚ “I am now passing.”

wellam—Cyrus. The protasis is suppressed : (ςί possem),
vellem equidem (ιιι) possem yloriari idem quod Cyrus
(aboriatur) z “ if 1 could, 1 would like, to be sure, to be
able to make the same boast as Cyrus does.'’ See
note 13, ξ 26. For the omission of ut, see H. 493, 2 ;
A. & G. 331, f. Rern. What does this form of the
hypothetical sentence imply? 11. 5103 A. & G. 308.

⁸queo is weaker than poenum: queo, “ 1 am able‚'' be-
cause circumstances allow me to do it ; possum, ‘⁶1
am able,'' because 1 have sufficient powen--qtaeo is
seldom found without a negative.

‘eis viribus. H. 4283 A. & G. 251. For the facts here
stated, see Life of Cato in the Introduction.

⁶saer2’m. H. 501, 1 ς A. & G. 319.—cum depuqnavi. H.
518, 11. 3; A. & G. 325: “when 1 put a finishing
stroke on the war.” For the soree ot de ε cp. debello,
devinco. The battle referred to was fought 191 B.C.
between the forces of AntiochuS, King of Syria, and
the Romans under M’. Acilius Glabrio.

⁸non —senet „us ι “ age has neither completely unstrung
me, nor broken me down. ’' Notice the anaphora3 see
