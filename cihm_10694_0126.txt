discussion on this point, Z. 189.

Life of Scipio.

Quintus: all the MSS. give tertius. There is a difficulty
whichever reading we adopt. Ifquintus were right, this
would put Scipio's death at 185 B. C„ and this would
agree with his Subsequent statement, annu-s· (mle me
censorem mortuus est, since Cato was censor in 184
B. C. The commonly received date of the death of
Scipio, however, is 183 B. C., the year in which Han-
nibal and Philopoemen died.

the memory of that hero.''

cons-etl ‹lesiynatus in the consulship of Cato. The
consulship os Cato was 195 B. C.. while Scipio’s
second consulship was 194 B. C. The consuls were
elected sometime before the 1st of January when they
entered on office, and during the ἰη’ vening period
were styled consules (Ζθεὶῃηαίἱ.

⁸3ummum consilinm: “our supreme deliberative body.''
The usual distinction between consilium and concilium,
that the former means, advice, plans, while the latter
means, an assembhge, with regard to those who eom-
pose it, does not hold good. Consilium is generally
applied to the senate: cp. Cic. Phil. 4, 6; 7, 7.
