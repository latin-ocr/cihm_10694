PREFAGE.

...4—

In preparing this Edition of the Cato Βία jor, the Editor

Ι has kept in view the requirements of Students reading

fm- the High School Intermediate and the University

’ Pass Matriculation Exaininations. The greatest care has
⁴ been taken to render clear the meaning of the text, both

by translations of difficult passages, and by copious

references to the Latin Grammars of Harkness, and

> Allen and Greenough. The Edition of the former
,ὁ Grammar used in the notes is that of 1871, but for the

benefit of those who have the latest American Edition

ἰ (1881), a table will be found at the end of this work in

which are given the corresponding sections of the two

K Editions.

Α In the text, the Editor has adopted, almost without
. exception, the orthography sanctioned by recent investi-
* gations in Philology, and now generally employed in
the best Editions οῗ Latin authors. The following may

ἱ ³ be summarized as the chief points in this respect ε

(l) The genitive of nouns in, —ius and, -ἰιιηι is written,
-ἰ, not —izt

, (2) The diphthongs oe, ae, are so written, not oe, cr.
