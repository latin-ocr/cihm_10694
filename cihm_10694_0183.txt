lit by the nearest relatives of the deceased. Cato here
means that the son would in the ordinary course of
events survive the father. At first the Romans interred
their dead, but sometimes adopted the Greek custom
of creination, which is mentioned in the laws of Numa
and in those of the XII. Tables. The practice ufburn-
ing the dead did not come into very general use till the
end os the Republic (Cic. de Legg. 2, 203 Pliny.
