”haecomnia The singular ἱηεοηιηίιι, ae, is found neither in
Caesar nor in Cicero. The plural expresses frequent
returns of the state. Pliny uses trigamiam as the
form—aliquid «latidum esc: “some indulgence must
be given.’'-—ala·qai.-e is more emphatic than qnia, aster ni.

in 260 B. C. He was the first Roman who gained a
naval triumph, the memor-y of which perpetuated by a

The sztnale was a torch formed os withs or twigs
twisted into a rope (funis) and dipped in pitch or oil.
The clientes often escorted their patroni home with
torches aster sunset. Mommsen reads cereo : “ with a
single wax torch and flute player‚'’ alluding to the
primitive sim plicity of those early days.
