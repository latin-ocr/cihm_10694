Praetor, popular as plebeian aedile that he was chosen ’ W*

¹⁹⁸ ¹³·C· praetor for the following year, and allotted the Α th*

province of Sardinia. On his arrival he began ’ Th

to institute a strict, but honest system of ¹ ‘¹³¹¹

government, which was in striking contrast with ²¹¹⁴

the lax and corrupt administration so much , Γ(

in vogue at that time. 'l'he army was brought q ⁰¹¹

into perfect discipline, law-breakers were merci· ⁰ Μ’ ¹

lessly punished, the rights of provinciale were 'ut

mum, respected, and the Roman government conse· ‘ef‘

ιιιῡ Β.ὀ. quently held in esteem. Valerius Flaccus, his f‘ ¹tt¹

κ, »eal ot· old and tried friend, shared with him the con· f ΟΕ
121¹ oppia. sulship. Soon after entering upon office, he ’ ie

strenuously opposed the repeal of the ¹Oppian ’ sth‘

Law, but even his eloquent pleadings in favour ’ V*

of economy were of no avail. Before going to 1 0¹}ss

his province, Spain, he passed a bill protecting : mse

,m rnle in the rights of provincials against the rapacity of }' ῗΠῙ
Sinin. Roman governorS. Desirous of checking ex· Τ mh
travagance by example as well as by precept, he ¹¹⁸0

set out for his province with characteristic ξ’ '²⁰¹⁵
economy. Leaving his house with only three 2¹¹5

a ι

servants, but being struck with the idea that so ἶ.
small a number was hardly in keeping with the ξ),
social ‹lignity of a Roman consul, he bought ²
two slaves at the forum, and proceeded on his η
journey. In Spain he carried out the same .
,, policy as he had done in Sardinia, and on his ¹ ’
ἸΙιΙῗέ-Ιιῖῗῇιὲξγ- return was honoured with a triumph. After
1’ω’ΜΒῺ·ερειιιῶυς a year on his farm he served in the

 

¹ Lex oppia, passed in 214 B.c.‚ enacted that no woman should wear on Δ. „
her dress above ᾗ oz. of gold ; that she should not possess a gai-ment οἱ μ

ιΗίῖοι-εῐιι colours, nor ride in a carriage in the city, unless on the occasion ‚ -
of a religious ceremony.
