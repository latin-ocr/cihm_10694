that Ι am praising such an old age as has been built
on the foundations of a (weil spent) youths-adules-
cenciae, sc. bene accae. For the subjunctive see H.
501, 1 ; Α. 8: G. 320, a.

²6oe ‹leco—dixi: “whence this follows what Ι once said
with the marked respect of all.''--z'd quod: H. 445, 7 ;
A. & G. 200, e.

³qzcae——dqfemleretz “if it has to defend itself with a
plea.'' H. 5193 A. & G. 316.

⁴cani, sc. capilli. The same elipsis is found in Ovid, M.

ι 3, 275. Many adjectives are used as nouns: as Africus

(ventus), fera (ba-scia), hiberna (castra), triremis
(navis), resse'a (domus).

‘'J'rzccltus—„extremosz “receives the reward of respect at its

ἓ 63.—¹salutar2·.. ,consum “to have men call on you, court you,
get out of the way for you, rise at your entrance, escort
you down (to the forum), escort you back, ask your
advice.'’ These were the customary marks of respect
paid by clientes to the patroni.. N otice that decede· and
asem-gli are used impersonally, as they govern a dative
in the active.

and in other states are obser-ved with the greatest care.-
fulness just in proportion‚ as each (state) isa-astinguished
in morals.'’ Distinguish m5ror, Ίηόιυν.

Nusquam and usquam refer to place; nunquam and
unquam, to time.

‘qtcin eciam: “yes, indeed‚'’ here corroborates a former
mammem—quin (·-- quine) is derived from the old
relative and interrogative ablative qni, and the negative
particle. Its primitive signification is how not (30 that
not). Hence with interrogatives arises the meaning,
why not ? and from this, 3163, indeed (why not, indeed ?)
M. 375, obs. 4.

memoriae: literally, '⁶ for the recollection‚'’ i.e., of pos-
terity. We also have the ablative with a different
meaning: memoria prodi.-Athem·³: local abl. H.
