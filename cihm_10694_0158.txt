CHAPTER XV.

§51.—¹nec—ec. In such combinations as nec—em et——nec ,·

neque—que, uec or neque = et non or non.

²‹et-accedere: ‘⁶ and to me they seem to come nearest
the lise osa wisc man.’' Cato was an eminent authority
on agriculture. The first Latin treatise on this subject
(De Re Rustica) was written by him and remained for
many years a standard .. ork.

‘mahom rationem: “they have to do with,'' literally, “they
have dealings with,'' a mercantile phase : cp. habet com-
mercium, note 4, ἓ 42.

⁴reczmat, imperium ε “takes exception to one’s authority,''
a legal phrase : so recusatio, ‘⁴ a plea in defence,'' “ a

occaecatum: “hidden,'' from ob, and caecus, used
here in the sense of “unseen.''

‘becacio ι “harrowing.'' Varro derives it from ob, caedo,
i.e.‚ cutting the earth. Corssen takes it from the root
uz, “sharp'': from the pointed teeth os the harrow
(occa).

‘’deinde—viriditatem z “in the second place when warmed
by heat and its own compression it shoots up and lures
forth the green blade of corn just springing out of it.”
——tepetocteaem‚ agreeing with semen going before.—
m‘aea: “ supported by.”

¹⁰0almoque—includitur2 “and raised on a knotted stalk

is now enclosed, as if in a sheath‚ with the down of
youth.'’ Join vayz'n-is with includitur.

¹¹e quibas—aristarum : “ from which, when once it shoots
forth, it yields the grain of the ear heaped in order,
