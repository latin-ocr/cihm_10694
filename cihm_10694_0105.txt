C.·.t. 1, 8, emnil «necemus, ecquid animadvertis horum.
silentium. The other compounds of en (or ec before q)
have a negative meaning as enanqelam, ecquando.
Z. 351. Ec or en is simply interjectional, and has no
connection with ecce, “ behold.’'

¹3praemi. Another reading is prelii. The genitive of

nouns in-ium, is ἱ, not ἱὶ in Virgil, Horace, Tibullus
and Propertius. Ovid seldom uses ii. The MSS. of
Cicero leave us in doubt as to his usage. Z. 49. l'or
the gen. see H. 396, 111. 2, 33 A. & G. 216, 3.

‘’ille-fidei: “that man (furnished) with no great wealth,

but full of integrity‚” referring to the shephcrd men·
tioned above. —haud is stronger than non, and is chief-ly
used to limit adjectives and adverbs denoting a measure.
ln the case of verbs it is seldom used, except in the
phrases, haud scio, haud dubito. Note the litotes in
haud vna-qna. There is little force in cum here, as the
the meaning would be expressed without it. M. 257,
258. Notice the scansion of this line. In the older
Latin poem, final 3, in the case of-z'cs and—{8 had a
slight and scarcely perceptible sound, before a word
beginning with a consonant, and was, therefore, disre-
garded in scansion, so that the ιι or ἱ remained short.
The quantity of fidei is also found in Lucr. 5, 103,
but commonly fidei. So also e is common in rei and
only short in spei.

¹⁰{Juamquam = καίτοι, “and yet,’' corrective to a former

statement. M 443.

¹¹cerlo scio: “ Ι am positive.'’ Distinguish certo, a

particle of affirmation, “surely‚'’ “certainly,'’ from
cerlo, which generally modifies a statement, ‘⁶ at least.'’
Certe is, however, often used for certo, especially in tl '²
phrase certe scio, which is more common in Cicero
tl‘an cerlo scio. Z. 266, note 1.

construction would be, ul Flamininus sollicitatur.

”noctesque diesque. The use of -que -que for et--el is ¹

poetical. Sallust is che only goorl prose writer who
uses it. Cat. 9: seque remque publica-m curabam&
cp. also Jug. 10. The only exception to this is when
—que is appended to a relative, as in quique exissent,
quique ibi man-sissent. Z. 338.
