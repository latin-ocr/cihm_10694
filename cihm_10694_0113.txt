Nonas - CRAP. 111. [ξ 6-§ 7.

neuter gerundive, if the verb is transitive, is used in
early and unclassical writers as Plautus, Lucretius and
Varro, ancl in the poets who affected an archaie ¹style,
as Silius Italicus, 'l'he only passages in Cicero arethe
present one and Fragm. p. Scaur. 13: obliviscendum
nobis putati-3 matrum in libero-9, virorum in, 'temore-3
scelera. It is probable that Cicero imitated the Greek
construction of verbals ἰη-τέος, as we may say
ταῦτα ἡμῖν ποιητέα ἐστίν, or ταῦτα ἡμῖν ποιητέον ἐστίν,

A. δι G. 294, c. ; M. 421, b. ; Z. 649.

CHAPTER 111.

ᾗ 7.--Ῑιιι, correlative to a suppressed ita lirniting faciam: “ Ι

shall do so, as well as I can.'' So ubi—ibn uncle—
inda-enim, refers to faciam.

ΩΡανεε-σοηῃνεῃαηιιιν .· “ now likes, according to the old
saying, with likes mate the readiest.'' There are
many forms of this proverb in Greek. Hom. (Jd. 17,
218 z ὡς αἰεὶ τὸν ὁμοῖον ἄγει θεὸς ὡς τὸν ὁμοῖον; “ since
heaven ever brings like to like.'’ Plato. Symp. 195, B.:
ὁμοῖον ὁμοίῳ αἰεὶ πελάζει, “like ever flocks to like.‘'
Phaedo 240, c. ε ἧλιξ τὸν ἣλικα τὲρπει; “ one of the
same age pleases one of the same age.'' Arist. Eth.
N ich. κολοιὸς ποτὶ κολοιόν, “ jackdaw to jackdaw‚’' or
as wle Ehiglish have it, “birds of a feather flock
toget ier.

8(Ιιιαε .· cognate acc. governed. by deplorare, and referring
by a sense construction (synesis) to querellis: ‘⁴ and
these things.” H. 445, 5 ; Α. &Q 199, b. Another
reading is quas.—deplorare : “ to whine about.’'

*tum- —tum .· ‘⁴ on the one hand—on t'ne other.''

Quod—carerent& quod depends on deplorare, and the
subjunctives arise from the oblique form. H. 531, ;
A. & G. 336.-—vitam nullam: “Life no life at all,‘'
or, “ lise not worth the name :’' cp. βίος ἀβίωτος.

‘non iel-accusandum: “ seemed to blame a thing that
did not deserve complaint.'' The subjunctive in esset
arises from the use of id = tale uc, implying a class
notion. H. 501, 1 ; A. & G. 3²0·

'eadem—venirent .· ‘⁸ the same things would be experienced
by me.''--u8u = usui, dat. ofpurpose. H. 390, Ι. 3 A.
& G. 233. Cicero seems to use usui venire m almost
the same sense as accidere.
