as ‘sit subjects sor comedy, stupid old men‚’ he
means by this that they are easily imposed upon, sor-

Sylla warneri the optimates in regard to Caesar; ιιι

from the ·›1nedy of Caecilius (now lost) called Epiclerus

stultos aene-s Ver-saris acque ema-naeeris lautissime. An
old man, stupid and soolish, the sport and dupe of
some young spenthrift or cunning slave is a stock
character in the old Latin comedy.

orum.
