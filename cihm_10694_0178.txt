with «liridi supplied astet pom-ut. 'lhe doctrine here
referred to is found in the l'haedo of Plato (ξ 24 -ξ 34)
and may be stated thus· ι Nothing can be di ssolved or
dissipated‚ unless it is compounded, sor dissolution
is a return into original elements. Now the soul is
simple, uncompounded, not cognizable by the senses,
and, therefore, incapable of dissolution, but endued
with properties of existence independent of the body.

¹⁰ma51noque—recordari: “and it is a strong argument

that men know very many things in a previous state of
existence (literally, before they are born), because,
even though boys, when they are learning ‹lifficult
subjects, so quickly do they comprehend an enclless
variety of things, that they do not seem then for the
first time to be thuiring thern, but to be recalling them
to memory and to be dwelling on the recollection of
them. '⁹ We htve here a reference to Plato’ s doctrine
ofpre— —natal ideas. Platodistinguishes ιηημὴ, ‘memoryss
the conservative srenhy, the preserver ofsensation, from
ἀνάμνησις, “·ιεεο]1εεῖίοη,’ the repioductive facultyst ‘the
recollection of those things which the soul saw (in
eternity), when journeying in the train of the‹leity.’'
(Phaedrus ,ξ 62). All knowledge (Phaedo ξ 17—,S 22)
is the recollection of truth unfolded to us in a former
state of being, sor there is nothing real but the idea, to
which we cannot attnin in this lise. From this Plato
deduces the doctrine of Immortality. Wordsworth has
referred to the same doctrine in his (Ma on Intinmlions
os Imnwrtality from Revelotions of Early Claildlaood.

Oui· birth is but a sloep and a soi-gotting5
The soni that rises with us, our life's star,
Hath had elsewhere its settiug,

And cometb from asar;

Not iu entire forgetfulness

And not iu utter nakednesS,

But trailing clouds ot* glor-y do we come
From God, who is our Home.

most part the arguments os Plato.”
