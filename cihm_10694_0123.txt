7ιμιίΙηιε, and eis are governed hy a, in a rebus verendis.

tum—viribus. Zumpt (353) says that an is used in its
proper sense only, and by Cicero exclusively, in a
second or opposite question where we use, ‘⁶ or.’' He
supplies here, aliisue before an. Perhaps omnibusne

things) or (merely) those which are carried on in the
time of youth and vigor.'' Some regard juventute et
viribus, a hendiadys = juventutis viribus.

mss—tamen .· ‘⁴ notwithstanding (these infirmities).''

{sente ia: nominative, “the vote of the Senate was

3ηοη dubitavit: “he did not hesitate.’' When dubito
